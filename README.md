# FLOG

**FLOG** is a service with **F**riendly **L**ocal **O**ffers and **G**oods.

Our main idea is based on the problem of the separation of the platforms used by students about the placement of ads (such as Avito, Help at NSU, dormitories chats) and the lack of their functionality.
Mostly, when an NSU student needs to buy/sell something, find something they've lost, find a way to have fun or create an announcement for an event - they use different means to do so, each with its own drawbacks and inconveniences.

As we see this process, when using our website:
- Posting an ad:
    - The user fills in the ad submission form, adds a description, leaves their contacts and, if they wish, attaches photos and indicates the price.
    - In doing so, the user will be assured that only real people associated with NSU can respond to their ad.

- Response to the ad:
    - Every user can leave a comment on the ad with any question or offer.
    - All users can see information on how to contact the author of the advertisement.
    - In case of a sale ad, the user can reserve the item in the ad to make sure that the item cannot be bought before them.

In this way, we will create a convenient platform that combines several others at once. At that, registration is compulsory through the NSU email, thus guaranteeing that person's connection to the university.
